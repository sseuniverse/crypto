title: btoa
---

A port of the browser's `btoa` function.

Uses `Buffer` to emulate the exact functionality of the browser's btoa (except that it supports some unicode that the browser may not).

It turns binary data to base64-encoded ascii.

```jsx showLineNumbers
var bin = "Hello, 世界";
var b64 = btoa(bin);
 
console.log(b64); // "SGVsbG8sIBZM"
```
